How to use this script: copy the users and administrators in a text file on the guest. Remove everything execpt the users and administartors. You should get a list like this.
User
Administartor
User
...
Make sure to remove your user, as you don't want to change your password. Label it "users" and put in the Documents folder. Then go to the first line of the script, next to the "Get-Content C:\Users\eleven" replace "eleven" with the user that you are currently using. Then open powershell ISE in admin mode, and copy and paste the entire script into powershell click enter and cross your fingers.
